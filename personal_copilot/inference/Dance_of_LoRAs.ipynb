      "The main difference is that ML models are trained on data that is already labeled (e.g., images), whereas DL models learn from data without labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?\n",
      "Supervised learning: training examples contain both input features and desired outputs. Unsupervised learning: training examples only contain input features; the goal is to find patterns in the data without knowing what the output should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference between reinforcement learning and supervised learning?\n",
      "Reinforcement learning: agent interacts with its environment by taking actions at each step and receiving rewards and penalties in return for those actions. Supervised learning: agent learns from labeled training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference between classification and regression?\n",
      "Classification: predicting discrete classes such as “cat” or “dog.” Regression: estimating a continuous value such as a price.\n",

      "What's the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model?\n",

      "What's the difference between a linear model and a non-linear model?\n",
      "Linear models are characterized by a weight matrix W and bias vector b that define a linear relationship between the input features and the target label. Non-linear models have more complex relationships because they involve non-linear functions applied to the input features.\n",

      "  <|assistant|> I can show you how to use LoRA with PEFT.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Let's get started!\n",
      "  <|assistant|> First, we need to create an LoraConfig object. This will contain all the parameters required by the LoRA layers.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> We'll start with the most basic one: `LoraConfig()`.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> The only parameter here is `r`, which stands for the dimensionality of the low-rank matrices.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> By default it is set to `128`.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Next, let's create our model. Here we're going to use [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM`], but feel free to use whatever type of model you'd like.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> In this example, we'll use the same tokenizer and configuration as before.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Now comes the interesting part: we wrap the base model inside a [`get_peft_model`] function.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> This allows us to easily apply different types of adapters to the model.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> For this tutorial, we want to use a [`LoraModel`].\n",
      "  <|assistant|> To do so, we pass three arguments to the `LoraModel`:\n",
      "  - The base model.\n",
      "  - The config containing the hyperparameters.\n",
      "  - A list of modules whose weights we want to adapt (in our case just the linear layer).\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Finally, we call the [`~transformers.Trainer.train`] function on the training loop.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> And that's it! You've just trained your first LoRA model with 🤗 PEFT.\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Congrats!\n",
      "  <|assistant|> Say hi to your new friends 🥳\n",
      "  <|assistant|> And now go have some coffee ☕️, because this was a long tutorial 😅.\n",
      "  <|prompter|> Thanks for the help!\n",

      "# Quantile Normalization\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantile normalization is a data preprocessing technique which scales each feature so that its distributions have the same median and interquartile range. It's often used when dealing with heterogeneous features such as images, audio or time series data. \n",
      "\n",
      "The idea behind quantile normalization is simple: we first calculate the quantiles of each feature independently using the empirical CDF method, then normalize each feature to match the corresponding quantile values. This ensures that all features have similar distributions after quantile normalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this guide, you'll learn how to implement quantile normalization from scratch in PyTorch.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement quantile normalization, you need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate the quantiles of each feature independently using the empirical CDF method.\n",
      "2. Normalize each feature to match the corresponding quantile values.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Calculating the quantiles\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's define some helper functions to calculate the quantiles efficiently. We'll use NumPy to speed up the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sorting\n",
      "\n",
      "We can sort an array quickly using [`numpy.sort`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import numpy as np\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "arr = np.array([1, 4, 2, 3])\n",
      "sorted_arr = np.sort(arr)\n",
      "print(sorted_arr)\n",
      ">>> [1 2 3 4]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Empirical CDF\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can calculate the empirical CDF of a random variable X using [`numpy.searchsorted`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html), which returns the indices where elements should be inserted to maintain order.\n",
